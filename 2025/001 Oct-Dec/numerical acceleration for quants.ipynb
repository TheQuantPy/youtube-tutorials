    "## Numerical Acceleration Techniques for Python based Quant Researchers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Speed Matters in Quantitative Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes formula shown below is a beautiful example of an **analytical solution** - a closed-form mathematical expression that gives us an exact answer instantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 S^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} + (r - q)S \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} - rC\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**But here's the reality:** Black-Scholes is the exception, not the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, most problems in quantitative finance have **no analytical solution**:\n",
    "- American options (early exercise boundary is unknown)\n",
    "- Path-dependent options (Asians, lookbacks, barriers with discrete monitoring)\n",
    "- Multi-asset derivatives (basket options, spread options)\n",
    "- Stochastic volatility models (Heston, SABR)\n",
    "- Jump-diffusion processes (Merton, Kou)\n",
    "- Credit derivatives with default correlation\n",
    "- Real-world portfolio optimization with constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "For these problems, we're forced to use **numerical methods**:\n",
    "- Monte Carlo simulation (thousands to millions of paths)\n",
    "- Finite difference schemes (large PDE grids)\n",
    "- Binomial/trinomial trees (deep recursion)\n",
    "- Numerical optimization (calibration, hedging)\n",
    "- Machine learning models (training on massive datasets)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Need for Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "As quantitative researchers, we live at the intersection of **mathematics, statistics, and practical implementation**. Our workflow is iterative:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prototype** a new model or pricing algorithm\n",
    "2. **Refine** the numerical accuracy and stability\n",
    "3. **Calibrate** to market data (often requiring thousands of evaluations)\n",
    "4. **Backtest** strategies across years of historical data\n",
    "5. **Deploy** for real-time risk management and trading\n",
    "\n",
    "At every stage, **speed is everything**:\n",
    "- **Research phase**: Faster code means more iterations, better models\n",
    "- **Calibration**: 10x speedup turns a 10-minute fit into 1 minute\n",
    "- **Production**: Real-time pricing of a large portfolio demands millisecond latency (pricing thousands of contracts simultaneously)\n",
    "- **Risk management**: End-of-day VaR calculations across thousands of scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "Even a seemingly \"fast\" Python function called **millions of times** becomes a bottleneck. In production systems, we often need to price entire portfolios—**hundreds or thousands of contracts at once**—which demands vectorization and batch processing to avoid iterating through contracts one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore practical acceleration techniques that can give you **10x to 1000x speedups**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vectorization** (NumPy) - leveraging optimized C/Fortran backends\n",
    "2. **JIT compilation** (Numba) - turning Python loops into machine code\n",
    "3. **GPU acceleration** (JAX, PyTorch) - massive parallelism for large-scale computations\n",
    "4. **Parallel processing** (joblib) - distributing work across CPU cores\n",
    "5. **Smart library choices** (comparing QuantLib, py_vollib, custom implementations)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start simple with Black-Scholes as a benchmark, then build up to more realistic scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's take a look.**"

    "### Why is QuantLib so much slower?\n",
    "\n",
    "QuantLib is built for **flexibility and production robustness**, not tight micro-benchmarks. It's like showing up in full mountaineering gear when everyone else is sprinting in running shoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The overhead:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heavy object construction every call** - evaluation date, payoff, exercise, option object, spot handle, rate curve, volatility surface, Black-Scholes process, and pricing engine\n",
    "2. **Python ↔ C++ boundary crossings** - Every `Handle` and `shared_ptr` has overhead (smart pointer providing automatic memory management). Fine for one trade, terrible for 100k in a loop.\n",
    "3. **Built for generality** - Supports arbitrary calendars, day count conventions, curve bootstrapping, stochastic processes, dozens of pricing engines. You pay for features you're not using.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In contrast:**\n",
    "- `py_vollib` is a thin wrapper over compiled C code\n",
    "- Pure NumPy is just vectorized operations and two normal CDF calls\n",
    "- No setup. No stateful objects. Just the math.\n",
